# CSC210 Final Group Project: Scheduling App

## How to Use

To enter the flask app's virtual python environment, navigate to the `schedule-app` directory and run:

* `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
* `source venv/bin/activate` on macOS or Linux

Then, to run the application, just run:

`flask run`

## To-Do List

* Come up with name
* Build application

## Known Problems

* 'Remember Me' does nothing
* Attempting to signup with non-unique email leads to raw flask error page
